This project outlines an analysis of 10 countrys' spending data, primarily based on three factors:
1) Education spending
2) Healthcare spending
3) Military spending

Several datasets were used primarily from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD - https://data.oecd.org/) and Our World In Data (https://ourworldindata.org/). The military spending dataset was obtained from SIPRI. The Expenditure Report provides a detailed view of the data from different perspectives for the years 2010-2014.

Some key conclusions drawn from the analysis are:
> The United States shows a strong and consistent record of spending across all education, healthcare, and military expenditures
> India shows a 44% growth rate in education spending, while the United Kingdom has recorded exponential growth in healthcare spending
> All countries have been mostly consistent in their spending for education and healthcare from 2010 to 2014, with the exception of US spiking in healthcare expenses from 2013
